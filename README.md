Iâ€™m @danclough.

## Interests
I'm a developer, DevOps-focused engineer, and technology architect.  I have specific interests in networking, cloud infrastructure and architecture, and distributed systems.

Most of my attention these days has been focused on Kubernetes and cloud-native computing.  I'm actively looking for open-source projects to contribute to.

If you'd like to see more of me, follow me on [Mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@danclough), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dan_clough), or check out my [website](https://bufferoverflow.xyz) where I write very infrequently about my experience with home labs and other projects and technologies that pique my interest.

## Personal values
I strive to be an ally and to use my position of privilege to advance social equity, equality, and justice.
